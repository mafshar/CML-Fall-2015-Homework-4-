# CML-Fall-2015-Homework-4

This contains three files: a kmeansImplementation.py, a projectMaterials.py, and a new project report.

The kmeansImplementation.py file contains three separate implementations of the KMeans algorithm. There has be code written to test each function at the end. Uncomment any function you wish to test. 

The projectMaterials.py file contains the two main functions, learn_vocabulary() and getbof(), along with code that is a first implementation of our project. This file also relies on the Simpsons/Futurama dataset, which has been given it's own directory structure. 

The project report has been updated to reflect the progress of this assignment.
